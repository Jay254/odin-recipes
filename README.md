PROJECT NAME: Jay's Recipes

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This is a website that displays a list of 10 recipes for Mother's Day. I used index.html as the landing page to display the 10 food items, with relative links to each recipe's page. This project is currently plain html, and I look forward to adding css into it as I advance with The Odin Project.
